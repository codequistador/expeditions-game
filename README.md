# Lost Summits

This is a clone of the awesome card game "Lost Cities". I wrote it for fun and to practice with React and JS.

## Still ToDo

- [x] Set up SocketIO multiplayer
- [x] Better layout without dev console
- [x] Info panel w/ good looking error box and more.
- [x] Set up end of game messages
- [x] Add Rules
- [x] Better Lobby with player auth
- [x] Figure out how to reset server when a new game is created
- [x] New game flow
- [x] Style game setup flow
- [x] Add the ability for someone to set their name and declare themselves ready
- [] Typescript all the things
- [] Cleanup code
- [] Play again flow

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run serve`

Runs a node server and serves up the game.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
